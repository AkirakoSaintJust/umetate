# Feature contract: stability sweep

## Identity

- **Feature:** Milestone 6b, the plugin stability and edge-case sweep.
- **Brief section:** `plugin/README.md` §12 rung 11 and §13 milestone 6b.
- **Owner / date:** P1Onken, 2026-11-04.
- **Disposition:** accepted.

## Player outcome

- **What the player can do that they could not do before:** push every control to
  its limit, play dense chords, change the session rate, and load a damaged state
  without the plugin going silent, hanging, or leaving the DAW with a non-finite
  sample.
- **How it sounds or behaves:** extreme patches may clip, as any synth may. They
  stay finite and the plugin keeps rendering. A damaged state is rejected or
  repaired, never trusted blindly.
- **How it fails visibly and safely:** the audio stays finite. A rejected state
  leaves the previous parameters in place.

## Dependencies and interactions

- **Other features:** the engine bridge, the parameter map, the rate bridge, the
  preset store, and the host wrapper.
- **Platform/API/HAL changes (if any):** none.
- **Persistence/version impact:** none. The test reads and writes the version 2
  state but does not change the format.
- **MIDI/clock impact:** none. The test feeds the existing MIDI bridge.

## Parameter and event semantics

- **Parameters, ranges, defaults, curves, units:** every manifest parameter is
  driven to its minimum and its maximum through the host parameter object.
- **Note/event ordering and ownership:** 256 note-ons, then note-offs, then a
  deterministic 9600-event storm of note on, note off, CC, pitch bend, channel
  pressure, and program change. The engine receives note, CC, and bend only.
- **Voice allocation and stealing:** the stress exceeds the 20-voice pool on
  purpose. The allocator must stay finite and must not crash.
- **Sustain/panic behaviour:** not changed. The storm includes note-offs. The
  existing panic path is untouched.

## Bounds and resources

- **Maximum voices/events/effects:** the stress sends 256 held notes and 24 events
  per block for 400 blocks.
- **Per-sample and per-block operations:** unchanged by the test.
- **RAM, flash, stack, pool:** the test allocates small standard containers on the
  test thread only. The audio callback still does no allocation.
- **Overflow/overload policy:** finite output is the gate. A loud, clipped signal
  is allowed. NaN, infinity, or a hang is a failure.
- **Division, shift, and range analysis:** no new arithmetic in the plugin.

## Files and interfaces

- **Candidate files:** `plugin/tests/plugin_stability.cpp`,
  `plugin/juce/CMakeLists.txt`, `plugin/README.md`.
- **Public contract/header:** none. The test uses the existing
  `TypePFm1AudioProcessor` interface and the generated parameter table.
- **State owner and publication rule:** the processor owns the state. The test
  round-trips it through `getStateInformation` and `setStateInformation`.
- **Forbidden dependencies (malloc, float, flash, display in audio):** the test is
  not in the audio callback. No new audio-thread allocation.

## Verification

- **Host vector(s):** `plugin_stability` runs the full sweep at 44.1, 48, 96, and
  192 kHz. It checks the reported latency at each rate.
- **Browser vector (if applicable):** none.
- **Target package check:** none. This is a host-side test.
- **Physical timing/device check:** blocked, no hardware.
- **Tolerance/metric:** every rendered sample is finite. The parameter extremes
  stay below an absolute peak of 100.0. The voice tail after 16 seconds is below
  0.05.
- **Evidence artifact:** the `plugin_stability` CTest output in the Linux
  container. The test passes in 0.14 seconds. Every check reports `ok`, including
  the parameter extremes, the polyphony burst, the MIDI storm, the rate changes,
  the state fuzz, and the voice tail.

## Risks and fallback

- **Assumptions/open research:** a finite output does not prove musical
  correctness. The parity and validator tests still carry that claim.
- **Safe experiment and stop criterion:** run the sweep on every plugin change.
  Stop on any non-finite sample, crash, hang, or latency mismatch.
- **Smaller alternative:** keep the smoke test and add only the state fuzz and
  rate changes. The full sweep is cheap enough to keep.
- **Rollback:** remove the `plugin_stability` test target. No production code
  depends on it.
