# Editor snapshot goldens

`plugin_editor_snapshot` renders every editor page and dialog to PNG. The
`plugin_editor_snapshot_diff` CTest compares the new images with this golden set.
It fails when an image is missing, extra, or different.

The gate runs only in the Linux container. Font rasterisation differs on other
hosts, so a Windows run is a manual review until a Windows golden set exists.

## When the UI is supposed to change

1. Build and run the snapshot test. The new PNGs are in the build tree under
   `juce/snapshots` (or `juce/snapshots` under your CMake build directory).
2. Open the changed images and the diff overlays in
   `juce/snapshot-diff` (red marks the changed pixels, side by side shows old and
   new).
3. If the change is intended, accept it:

   ```sh
   python3 plugin/tools/snapshot_check.py --update \
     --actual <build>/juce/snapshots \
     --golden plugin/tests/snapshots/linux-x86_64
   ```

4. Commit the new golden PNGs, `manifest.json`, and the code change in the same
   commit. The commit message says which pages changed and why.

Do not accept a snapshot change you cannot explain. A red pixel in the diff is a
question, not an error.

## When the UI is not supposed to change

Run the CTest. If it fails, inspect the diff. A failure means the editor changed
without the design being updated, or a dependency changed the rendering. Fix the
code or record the design change and update the golden set deliberately.

## Adding a page or dialog

Add the render to `plugin/tests/editor_snapshot.cpp`, run the test, review the
new image, and update the golden set. The manifest records the image size and
SHA-256.

## Why the golden images are committed

The gate needs a baseline that travels with the code. A hash alone would tell you
that something changed, not what changed. The PNGs are small (about 560 KB for
the current set) and they give the reviewer a visual history in git.
